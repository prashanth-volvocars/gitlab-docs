## Tasks for all releases

Documentation [for handling the docs release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/main/doc/releases.md) is available.

### Between the 17th and 20th of each month

1. [ ] Cross-link to the main MR for the release post: `<add link here>`
   ([Need help finding the MR?](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=release%20post&label_name%5B%5D=blog%20post))
1. [ ] Monitor the `#releases` Slack channel. When the announcement
   `This is the candidate commit to be released on the 22nd` is made, it's time to begin.
1. [ ] [Create a stable branch and Docker image for release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/main/doc/releases.md#create-stable-branch-and-docker-image-for-release). Do not create a merge request, just push the stable branch.
   - [ ] Verify that the `image:docs-single` job passed in the new pipeline, and
     created a Docker image tagged with the name of the branch. ([If it fails, how do I fix it?](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/main/doc/releases.md#imagedocs-latest-job-fails-due-to-broken-links))
1. [ ] [Create a release merge request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/main/doc/releases.md#create-release-merge-request)
   for the new version,
   which updates the version dropdown menu for the current documentation, and adds
   the release to the Docker configuration.
   - [ ] Mark as `Draft` and do not merge.
1. [ ] [Update the three online versions](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/main/doc/releases.md#update-dropdown-for-online-versions),
   so they display the new release on their version dropdown menus.

After the tasks above are complete, you don't need to do anything for a few days.

### On the 22nd, or the first business day after

After release post is live on the 22nd, or the next Monday morning if the release post happens on a weekend:

1. [ ] [Merge the release merge requests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/main/doc/releases.md#merge-merge-requests-and-run-docker-image-builds)
  and run the necessary Docker image builds.
   - [ ] Are all pipelines green?
   - [ ] Merge the MRs for updates to the dropdown menus.
   - [ ] Merge the docs-release merge request.
   - [ ] Each merge triggers a new pipeline for each stable branch. Check
     [the pipelines page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/pipeline_schedules)
     and wait for all the stable branch pipelines to complete before proceeding.
   - [ ] Go to the [scheduled pipelines page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/pipeline_schedules)
     and run the Build Docker images weekly pipeline.
   - [ ] In the scheduled pipeline you just started, manually run the `image:docs-latest`
     job that builds the `:latest` Docker image.
   - [ ] When the pipeline is complete, run the `Build docs.gitlab.com every 4 hours`
     scheduled pipeline to deploy all new versions to the public documentation site.
     No manually-run jobs are needed for this second pipeline.
1. [ ] After the deployment completes, open `docs.gitlab.com` in a browser. Confirm
   both the latest version and the correct `pre-` version are listed in the documentation version dropdown.
1. [ ] Check all published versions of the docs to ensure they are visible and that their version menus have the latest versions.
1. [ ] In this issue, create separate _threads_ for the retrospective, and add items as they appear:
   - `## :+1: What went well this release?`
   - `## :-1: What didn’t go well this release?`
   - `## :chart_with_upwards_trend: What can we improve going forward?`
1. [ ] Mention `@gl-docsteam` and invite them to read and participate in the retro threads.

After the 22nd of each month:

1. [ ] Create a release issue for the
   [next TW](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/release-posts/managers/)
   and assign it to them.
1. [ ] *Major releases only.* Update
   [OutdatedVersions.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/.vale/gitlab/OutdatedVersions.yml)
   with the newly-outdated version.
1. [ ] Improve this checklist. Continue moving steps from
   [`releases.md`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/-/blob/main/doc/releases.md)
   to here until the issue template is the single source of truth and the documentation provides extra information.
