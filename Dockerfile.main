# This Dockerfile is mainly used to create the docs:latest image which includes
# the latest 3 stable versions plus the most recent one built from main.
#

# First use the bootstrap image to build main
FROM registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs:bootstrap as builder

# Set up needed environment variables that are called with --build-arg when
# the Docker image is built (see .gitlab-ci.yml).
ARG NANOC_ENV
ARG CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME
# If CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME is not set (local development), set it to main
ENV CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME ${CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME:-main}

# Build the docs from this branch
COPY . /source/
RUN yarn install
RUN bundle install
RUN bundle exec rake setup_git default
RUN bundle exec nanoc compile -VV

# Compress images
RUN /scripts/compress_images.sh /source/public ee

# Symlink EE to CE
# https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-docs/issues/418
RUN cd /source/public/ && rm -rf ce && ln -s ee ce

# BUILD OF 'main' DOCS IS NOW DONE!

# Reset to alpine so we don't get any docs source or extra apps
